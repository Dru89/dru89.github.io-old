<p>Okay, so my dream was something along the lines of Harry Potter with Jack Skellington at the scene of an Orthodox Catholic Cathedral where we all lived and it had the same layout (and, for the most part, the same people) as ASMSA. &nbsp;Daniel Radcliffe was of course Harry Potter and Emma Watson was of course Hermione (Ron was conspicuously absent), and some bully had stolen Jack Skellington's skull and he had an apple in its place. &nbsp;We had to get it back from the bully, and I dumped a plate of hot linguine alfredo on him. &nbsp;It was brilliant. &nbsp;We got the skull back and then we had to go down into some creepy dungeon but we didn't because Harry was a pansy.</p>
<p>Oh, and most of the stairs had lines of electricity that bounced back and forth across each stair that you had to dodge and if you hit them you started over at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>Now I have a migraine. &nbsp;Stupid dreams.</p>
