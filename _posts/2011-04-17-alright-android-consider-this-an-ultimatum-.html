title: Alright Android, consider this an ultimatum.

<p><strong>The Ultimatum:</strong>&nbsp;Android has 8 months (January 2012) to fix their issues, or I will not be buying another Android phone. &nbsp;And I will talk myself blue in the face trying to convince everyone else to do similarly.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The reasoning is as follows...</p>
<p>I <em>really</em>&nbsp;want to like Android. &nbsp;A lot. &nbsp;in fact, it is by far one of my favorite [mobile] operating systems. &nbsp;But let's talk about Android's buzzword for about the last year. &nbsp;<strong>Fragmentation.</strong>&nbsp; Before, it didn't honestly bother me that much. &nbsp;I had my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Dev_Phone#Android_Dev_Phone_1">ADP1</a> (an unlocked G1), and I had it rooted with <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com">Cyanogenmod</a> on it. &nbsp;I happily updated my [excruciatingly slow] phone all the way up to 2.1 before I decided that it would be a much better idea to just bit the bullet, get a contract (because, like most good people, I can't afford to just drop $500 on a phone without a contract), and update my phone. &nbsp;So I went out and bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_2">Droid 2</a>. &nbsp;Big mistake. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure that I will <em>never</em>&nbsp;buy another Motorola phone again. &nbsp;So let's start with Motorola.</p>
<p>Motorola, you have killed the spirit of Android, in my opinion. &nbsp;The thing that I found the most exciting about these phones was that, if I didn't like something about it, I could get another OS and put it on there. &nbsp;And if I didn't like my options, I could compile my <em>own</em>&nbsp;OS and put it in there. &nbsp;Motorola has killed that idea. &nbsp;I am locked into their OS, <em>or</em>, if I want to go through the process of rooting my phone, I am locked into a couple OS's that are struggling to be able to provide any new updates, because it's difficult enough to get around the locks that Motorola has placed on the phone in the first place. &nbsp;The inability to put newer operating systems on these phones (that <em>clearly</em>&nbsp;have the specs to run them) has further increased fragmentation to an extremely aggravating point.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I guess the point I'm trying to make is, if I <em>do</em>&nbsp;wind up sticking with Android, I will <em>never </em>buy another phone in the Motorola line. &nbsp;I'd probably stick with HTC, unless they do something awful to screw it up as well.</p>
<p>Now let's take a moment from the complaining and discuss something that I <em>love </em>about Android. &nbsp;Which, consequently, isn't really about Android at all, but about a wonderful group of developers that seem to be just as frustrated as I am, but are actually doing something about it (aside from ranting on their blog). &nbsp;Cyanogenmod is the community that I'm speaking of. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure that without that group of developers, I would've left Android less than a year after I got my first phone. &nbsp;When I saw the work that they were doing, I became instantly satisfied with Android. &nbsp;Yes, there were bugs, but that was okay. &nbsp;It was new, it was cool, and they seemed like they kept the updates coming. &nbsp;Once again, because of them I managed to update my phone all the way to 2.1 before finally getting a new one. &nbsp;I had always really hoped that the phone developers learned the <em>right</em>&nbsp;lesson from them about what people want from their phone. &nbsp;Instead, this seems to be an oddly familar battle (David v.&nbsp;Goliath, The Music Industry v. Online Music, <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/08/fearing-itunes-like-domination-hollywood-plots-netflixs-downfall/">Hollywood v. Netflix</a>, etc.). &nbsp;Phone developers, instead of listening to what their users want and realizing that Cyanogenmod has a lot of happy users because they keep the ROMs up-to-date (as well as seemingly infinitely customizable) have just stopped listening and started acting on the defensive, trying to shut out any possible way that custom ROM developers can load their OS onto a phone. &nbsp;Some might think that I'm over-reacting a bit to the way the chips are falling, but this certainly seems to be the trend.</p>
<p>Okay, I still complained a lot in that last paragraph, but let's wrap this up. &nbsp;Once again, referring to my ultimatum, if I don't see an improvement by January 2012, I will not be buying another Android phone. &nbsp;I will also do my best to convince every single one of my friends that would think about buying an android phone that this is <em>not</em>&nbsp;the way to go. &nbsp;Now, don't think I'm foolish enough to believe that I have a lot of influence over people, or even that I have a lot of influence over what phones my friends will buy. &nbsp;Ultimately the end decision is theirs, as it should be. &nbsp;But this is about the only stance I feel like I can take at this point. &nbsp;I'm not sure which phone I'll switch to yet, but it will probably be the iPhone. &nbsp;I may not have the customizability that I would like with the iPhone, but at least I will rarely, if ever, run into this horrible fragmentation problem that I have now. &nbsp;It's also possible that I may dabble with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx">Windows Phone 7</a>, once they've made some improvements. &nbsp;We'll see who's winning the race in January. &nbsp;In any case, consider this an early New Year's Resolution for 2012.</p>
