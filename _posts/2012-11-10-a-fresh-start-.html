<p>I&rsquo;ve never been very good about blogging.  And now that I&rsquo;ve got a full-time job, it will probably be even harder.  I&rsquo;m going to try to commit to at least one blog post, a week, though.  I think if I keep with a theme, things will be a bit easier.  I&rsquo;m calling this theme &ldquo;Programming and Productivity&rdquo; until I come up with a better name.  There are two basic ideas, though (as illustrated in the title).</p>

<p>I want to keep this blog simple, so I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for all of my posts.  I picked posterous because it appears to be the only <em>free</em> platform that has all of the features that I want.  If you have a better solution, though, please let me know.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>Any interesting programming projects I&rsquo;m learning.  New languages I&rsquo;m looking into.  Blog posts about programming that I just want to drop a link to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already got some new ideas that I want to post about.  For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to learn LISP</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying to come up with useful applications for things like <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a> and <a href="http://www.golang.org">Go</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got a few web applications that I want to work on</li>
</ul>


<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>Anything that I find helps me when I&rsquo;m at work or home.  The idea is things that make my life easier.  This could be a wide variety of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>An excellent app that I&rsquo;ve found.</li>
<li>A good website for keeping track of things.</li>
<li>An interesting vim tip that I learn.</li>
</ul>


<p>There may be other things that I want to talk about. Random posts about Christmas, work, or home.  But the general trend of the blog should hopefully stay on the course of Programming and Productivity.</p>

<p>For next week, I think I&rsquo;m going to try to have a post about learning Lisp ready to go.  If it&rsquo;s not ready, I swear I&rsquo;ll have something.</p>
