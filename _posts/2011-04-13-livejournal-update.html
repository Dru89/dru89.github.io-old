<p>If you're reading this from my posterous feed, this really doesn't apply to you so you might as well stop.</p>
<p>If you're reading this from my LiveJournal feed, however, I have a quick update. &nbsp;I've disabled all comments from LiveJournal because I was somehow attracting a lot of spam. &nbsp;That's rather undesirable, so I've disabled all comments.</p>
<p>However, comments on <a href="http://blog.andrewhays.net" title="Posterous Blog">my posterous blog</a> will remain available, so feel free to leave comments on that one.</p>
