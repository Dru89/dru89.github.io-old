title: The Internet Sucks
published: true

<p>I realize that title probably seems like link-bait.  Maybe it is.  After all, without the internet, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a job.  You wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this post.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be sharing this post on TweetBook+.  Let me be a little more specific about what I&rsquo;m trying to say here:</p>

<p><strong><em>The social internet sucks.</em></strong></p>

<p>Still sound too general to you?  Deal with it.</p>

<p>Let me apologize for the tone of this post being the exact opposite of what it was for <a href="http://blog.andrewhays.net/love-your-terminal">Love Your Terminal</a>.  The response I got to that post was amazing.  This post is basically a rant.  It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve noticed about the internet since moving away from friends and family.  It&rsquo;s also what I&rsquo;ve noticed as a slow, growing trend over the last two to three years.  I&rsquo;ll break it down into a few key elements.</p>

<h3>Everything is too disjoint</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;Facebook friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;Twitter friends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Google+ friends,&rdquo; I have <strong>friends</strong>.  Unfortunately the spread themselves out across many different social networks.  Fortunately (I suppose), most of them choose Facebook.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that I want <em>one social network to rule them all</em>, or anything, just an easy way to communicate with my friends on a larger scale.  When I make an event on Facebook, I don&rsquo;t want to have to turn around to copy and paste all the details to an event in Google+.  When I find an interesting link on Twitter, I don&rsquo;t want to have to copy that link into Facebook and Google+.</p>

<p>My solution to this problem is fairly simple.  Whatever I post on Facebook auto-posts to Twitter.  Many of my tangential social networks (like Foursquare, Instagram, and this blog) auto-post to Facebook and Twitter.  This poses some problems, though.</p>

<ol>
<li>Google+ doesn&rsquo;t have a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/dont-expect-a-full-readwrite-google-api-anytime-soon-google-doesnt-want-to-disrupt-something-magical/">write API</a>.</li>
<li>I still have to maintain (at least) three threads of conversation between friends.</li>
<li>For my tangential networks, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/kevin-systrom-on-pulling-twitter-cards-integration-we-want-images-viewed-on-instagram-com/">either party</a> can choose to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/no-api-for-you-twitter-shuts-off-find-friends-feature-for-instagram/">remove functionality</a> at a whim.</li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;re at the mercy of our providers, and they don&rsquo;t seem to care.  Some can argue that they don&rsquo;t have to, and they don&rsquo;t really.  It&rsquo;s just disappointing that they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<h3>Everything is too combined</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<em>…but wait, you just said…</em>&rdquo;  Yeah.  I did.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m reading about the new baby that my friends just had, I really don&rsquo;t care about the fact that Michael Arrington is at Starbucks. (Sorry, <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington">Mike</a>.)  Twitter is worse about this than Facebook, now that Facebook uses some algorithm for posts.  That just brings about new problems that aren&rsquo;t worth bringing to light right now, though.  Somehow, Google+ seems to deliver this information te best.</p>

<p>I want my news separated from my friends.  Not to rip the two apart, but to find a better way to graciously mingle the two together.  Or some sort of slider to show just how news I want from pages I like integrated with my friends.  Sometimes my friends are more important and I want little to no news.  Sometimes I just want to read the news.  Facebook always seems to get the amount wrong every time, though.</p>

<h3>Organization is hard</h3>

<p>This point feeds off of &ldquo;Everything is too combined,&rdquo; but I felt it needed to be stated separately.  Despite what Facebook wants you to believe, I don&rsquo;t have 325 friends.  I couldn&rsquo;t maintain a group of 325 friends if I wanted to.  I have a few (maybe 5 or 6) good friends, 15-20 friends outside that initial group, 20-30 acquaintances, a lot of family, and some people that I met at that one place that one time for that one thing (and now I don&rsquo;t know who they are, where I was, or what I was doing).  Each social network seems to have a different solution to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Google+ has circles …that I have to maintain myself.</li>
<li>Facebook has <del>Dumb</del>SmartLists …that often gets the groups wrong or just flat-out doesn&rsquo;t add them.</li>
<li>Twitter has …something, I&rsquo;m sure they do.</li>
</ol>


<p>Sure, at some point it&rsquo;s up to me to keep track of who&rsquo;s my friend, who&rsquo;s an acquaintance, who I work with, and who I meet once a week for my yodeling club, but a little help would be nice.  Not only that, but sharing is a two-way street.  I know a lot of my friends don&rsquo;t care about my <a href="http://blog.andrewhays.net/love-your-terminal">terminal blog post</a>, but I don&rsquo;t care that the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/ncaa/wires/12/05/2060.ap.fbc.arkansas.bielema.2nd.ld.writethru.1488/index.html">Razorbacks got a new coach</a>.  I can solve your prolem by putting all my nerdy friends in a list and only sending the status to them, but how can I solve mine?  And I&rsquo;d really like my posts to be public, just filter out the friends that I know don&rsquo;t want to see it.</p>

<p>Some solutions exist, like <a href="http://socialfixer.com/">SocialFixer</a>.  I appreciate what SocialFixer does, but it doesn&rsquo;t really fix the problem.  It&rsquo;s a browser extension, so it only works on the website.  It also filters based on regular expressions, which is just gross (and not a solution for people that don&rsquo;t know regular expressions). SocialFixer is a great bandaid, but it&rsquo;s just not a remedy.</p>

<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have some big call-to-arms to boycott Facebook.  No sweeping declaration that I&rsquo;m leaving Twitter.  Right now it doesn&rsquo;t look like there&rsquo;s anything that we can do.  I&rsquo;m open to suggestions, if you have them.  It&rsquo;s just a realization that I had after I moved.  This was more of a post about how I&rsquo;ve realized that communication sucks right now.  It&rsquo;s better than it ever has been, I imagine, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
