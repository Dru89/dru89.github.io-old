<p>So for several years now, I've had this idea. &nbsp;Last night I started putting it into action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Phase 1) Scrape all of UALR's class information from their website, including classes, prerequisites, and professors teaching the courses from this year and last year.</p>
<p>(Phase 2) Build an educationally based social networking site (much like <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">blackboard</a>) but run by the students and for the students, so there's no issue of the potential of the site being squandered, simply because teachers don't know how or simply won't use it. &nbsp;[Obviously this phase will have multiple subphases.]</p>
<p>(Phase 3) ??? [Possibly get other schools to implement the idea, and at this point, I no longer have to resort to scraping data, because hopefully they'd just give it to me.]</p>
<p>(Phase 4) Profit.<span style=""> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="">N</span>o, it won't be marketed as a "facebook killer," because it doesn't compete with facebook. &nbsp;The only thing that I expect it will "kill," is the awful existence that is teachers not knowing how to use <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">blackboard</a>. &nbsp;I don't have any problems with the service, in fact I've seen some ways that it can be used very well. &nbsp;I don't think I know any professor that has really taken the time to learn to use the service, though. &nbsp;And why should they? &nbsp;There's no incentive. &nbsp;But if students could use this as a way to rate the professors, find out whether or not they should really be taking a class, get the notes from class that they might've missed, or upload some notes to help out others, I think we might be on to a more powerful method of learning. &nbsp;And while I don't see social networks being particularly useful right now for anything other than, well, being social, I see this as an extension that could come out of it and vastly improve the way that we learn.</p>
<p>Professors and faculty members, I know there's probably the question "What do we do to keep students from posting previous tests or homework assignments and just giving everyone the solutions?" &nbsp;Right now, the answer is nothing. &nbsp;You don't stop it. &nbsp;To be honest, even without this you never would stop it. &nbsp;But I'm sure there will be some methods to prevent this. &nbsp;Heck, I'm only done with Phase 1. &nbsp;Oh yeah, sorry about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ualr.edu/classes/201110_indextab.htm" title="This allowed me to get any abbreviations that were used for class information.">scraping</a> <a href="http://www.ualr.edu/classes/201110_57.htm" title="Even your terribly formed HTML pages were useless to stopping me from grabbing the class information.">your</a> <a href="https://boss.ualr.edu/pls/prod/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201160&amp;crn_in=61027" title="Yeah, this one will probably break.  Took some spoofing to get the data.  But this was the only way I could find to get the prerequisites.">data</a>, last night, <a href="http://www.ualr.edu">UALR</a>, but you made it <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">pretty</a> <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html">easy</a>.</p>
<p>Now we move on to Phase 2. &nbsp;Which will take a while. &nbsp;Going to start working on that tonight, probably.</p>
