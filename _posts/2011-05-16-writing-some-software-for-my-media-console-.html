title: Writing some software for my media console.

<p>I am slowly working on trying to create a desktop application for a media server that I would eventually like to put into the living room. &nbsp;Right now I'm more or less working on the emulation side of it. &nbsp;I would also like to be able to work movies into it, probably netflix streaming, maybe rewrite it into a Boxee or Windows Media Center plugin. &nbsp;Sometime next year I plan to get all the hardware for it, once I more or less have the software designs worked out. &nbsp;None of these actually play any games yet, but this is basically what the software looks like right now:</p>

<p>More or less, the layout idea is mine. &nbsp;I wasn't talented enough to make the controller images and obviously the title screens are not mine. &nbsp;But I did make the glass buttons, the halo, and piece it all together. &nbsp;The idea is a little rough right now, but I didn't want your standard "Windows Forms" look for this application, and I've never written anything like this before, so I'm mostly just going off of instinct here, and whatever else I think looks good.</p>
<p>The GUI is written in GTK#, using C# with mono-tools on Ubuntu. &nbsp;Eventually, when I finally get my desktop back up and running well enough that it doesn't crash when it's running Windows anymore (more on that later), I'll probably switch it over to either working with GTK# in .NET tools, if it's at all worth it, or look into rewriting the bits and pieces in Direct X or XNA. &nbsp;I originally looked at doing this in pythong, but I wanted to have a finalized, simple binary executable, with easily maintainable code. &nbsp;The images are in a folder strucuture right now, too, so that will probably all have to somehow change.</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited about this project, but I will have to set it down for a few months when I leave for Germany next Friday. &nbsp;Hopefully I'll be able to pick it back up pretty seamlessly. &nbsp;Time to go and document everything so I know what I did what I did. &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>As for my desktop. &nbsp;I've noticed that if I do anything too strenuous on it (i.e. watching a flash video &gt;.&lt;, very strenuous right?), it seems to occasionally just turn off. &nbsp;I'm thinking powersupply issue. &nbsp;I know it's not a graphics card issue. &nbsp;Does anyone else have suggestions on what to test?</p>
