title: My First Day in Hagen (With Pictures)
published: true
---
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:05am I departed for Hagen, Germany for a research trip at Fern University.&nbsp; After a 3 hour flight to Newark, New Jersey, a 6.5 hour layover there, a 6 hour flight to Dusseldorf, Germany, and then a 2 hour train ride to Hagen, I have finally arrived.&nbsp; Well, at least most of me has.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Continental did a lovely job of botching up about 20 people's luggage for the Dusseldorf flight, so I'm still waiting on most of my things to arrive.&nbsp; But whenever those get here, I should be ready to go.&nbsp; For now, I've got my netbook, a single change of clothes, and a few other things.</p>
<p>Anyways, one of the first things that I did when I got to my host house was to walk around the neighborhood, find a grocery store, and get some groceries.&nbsp; The neighborhod is absolutely beautiful, though, and I've posted some pictures of it below:</p>
