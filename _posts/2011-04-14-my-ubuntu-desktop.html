<p>After some hours of customization, I finally decided to give my ubuntu account some pizzaz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:qHhnmtHhmjkeGfhzckse]]Unfortunately, I don't know what else to include in my conky sidebar on the right. &nbsp;And I'm also going to replace the Ubuntu icon in the top left in favor of something else. &nbsp;Any other ideas on what else to add? &nbsp;Or things to add to conky?</p>
<p>This theme was <em>somewhat</em>&nbsp;stolen from <a href="http://blog.segfault.co.in/?p=73">this guy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>&nbsp;I also should switch the conky stuff to use Fahrenheit instead of celsius. &gt;.&gt;</p>
