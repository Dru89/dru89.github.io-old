<p>I haven't made a blog post in a really long time, and there's a lot to talk about. &nbsp;However, I don't really have the time right now either, but I intend to write within the week. &nbsp;For now, I'm just going to say that I know a lot of things on the blog are broken, but that's because I'm currently in the process of rewriting the layout for the website. &nbsp;In fact, the layout is going to match my website's <a href="http://www.andrewhays.net" title="Andrew Hays">new layout</a>, which is nearly complete.</p>
<p>So many exciting things are happening, and I soon I'll share about everything that's going on!&nbsp;</p>
