title: Here's An Optimization Problem For You Math and Computer Science People
published: true
---
<p>People of the internet (and all the cracks in between -- you know who you are):</p>
<p>I have an optimization problem for all of you. &nbsp;Find the best maximum between the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom: 0px;">Graduate programs that I want to go to.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 0px;">Graduate programs that I can afford to go to.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 0px;">Graduate programs that will accept me.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 0px;">And finally, a binary value of whether or not I actually want to attend graduate school <em>right now</em>&nbsp;-- where right now is actually meaning about this time next year.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for bonus, you can tell me the minimum as well. &nbsp;But that's mostly for hilarity's sake, whoever that is.</p>
<p>Some biographic information for those of you who aren't stalking me (I've <strong>boldfaced </strong>the keywords for you skim-readers): &nbsp;I am a <strong>computer science</strong>&nbsp;student attending <strong>UALR&nbsp;</strong>and I also have a major in <strong>mathematics</strong>. &nbsp;I am very interested in <strong>web development</strong>&nbsp;as well as <strong>scripting languages</strong>&nbsp;but I'm also good with <strong>compiled languages.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some interested in <strong>cryptography</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>security</strong>, although it is limited at best. &nbsp;Also, my <strong>dream job</strong> would be to work for <strong>Google </strong>as a developer, I think. &nbsp;<strong>I will write this last sentenced entirely boldfaced just to be mean to the people the skim-read (and also the people that don't, I suppose).</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your time in helping me make my college/career choices for me. &nbsp;I appreciate your [lack of?] honesty when answering my questions.</p>
