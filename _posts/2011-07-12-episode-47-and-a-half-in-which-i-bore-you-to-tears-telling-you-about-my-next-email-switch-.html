<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.  Actually, I don&rsquo;t, to be honest.  But if I were you (and presumably I&rsquo;m not, because I have no good reason to read through my own posts) I would probably be thinking about three things right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are you changing your email address <em>again</em>?</li>
<li>Why are you posting about it on your blog? Is it really necessary?</li>
<li>Why am I reading my own post?</li>
</ul>


<p>I will be using this post to attempt to answer those three questions and any questions that you might have (yes that&rsquo;s right <strong>you, dear reader</strong> &mdash; one of the two that still keep my blog in their RSS feed, mostly out of the fact that removing it might inconvenience you).</p>

<p>So anyways, I&rsquo;m here to get you started, I suppose by answer those three questions.</p>

<h4><strong>Q. Why are you changing your email address <em>again</em>?</strong></h4>

<p>A. To be fair, I&rsquo;m not really.  I plan on keeping and using <a href="mailto:me@andrewhays.net">me@andrewhays.net</a> for just about everything.  I like it.  I&rsquo;m kind of attached to it, and muddling up peoples contact books with the contact by the name of &ldquo;Me&rdquo; really makes my day.  But it&rsquo;s come to my attention that if I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://mail.google.com" title="Gmail">continue</a> <a href="http://voice.google.com" title="Google Voice">to</a> <a href="http://music.google.com" title="Google Music">use</a> <a href="http://docs.google.com" title="Google Docs">google</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/113786124985995510432/posts" title="Google+">services</a>, keeping up with two accounts is going to be a pain that I don&rsquo;t want to have to deal with.</p>

<p>So instead, I&rsquo;m going to continue to use <a href="mailto:me@andrewhays.net">me@andrewhays.net</a> to send and receive email, and you can continue to use it with me for gtalk, but I&rsquo;m also going to start using my lesser-known gmail account <a href="mailto:drewshays@gmail.com">drewshays@gmail.com</a> more often, and as my primary account, so that I don&rsquo;t have to switch Google accounts every five seconds.  Really, this is all because of <a href="https://plus.google.com/113786124985995510432/posts" title="Google+">Google+</a>, which I&rsquo;ve recently started really using.  All the other accounts I got used to having to make the switch whenever I&rsquo;d have to check once every few days.  However, now that I&rsquo;ve started using <a href="https://plus.google.com/113786124985995510432/posts" title="Google+">Google+</a> more frequently, I have to switch accounts all the time.  This is undesirable, obviously, and so I&rsquo;m going to put a stop to it.</p>

<h4><strong>Q. What does this mean to me?</strong></h4>

<p>A.  Nothing, probably.  If the only way you communicate with me is through <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Dru89" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://plus.google.com/113786124985995510432/posts" title="Google+">Google+</a>, feel free to keep doing everything the same way you&rsquo;ve always done it.  If you frequently send or receive emails to me, you can expect very little to change, although you might sometimes get an email from my <a href="mailto:drewshays@gmail.com">drewshays@gmail.com</a> email address.  If you have me added on Google Talk, while I would <em>prefer</em> that you switch to using <a href="mailto:drewshays@gmail.com">drewshays@gmail.com</a> to communicate with me, I&rsquo;m not going to do anything to stop you.  I can&rsquo;t guarantee that I will always be online, though (I will be with <a href="mailto:drewshays@gmail.com">drewshays@gmail.com</a>, on my phone), but the final decision is yours.</p>

<h4><strong>Q. Why are you posting about it on your blog?  Is that really necessary?</strong></h4>

<p>A. No not really.  I just like boring you.</p>

<h4><strong>Q. Why am I reading my own post?</strong></h4>

<p>A. You&rsquo;re not.  Unless you are, in which case I&rsquo;d advise you to stop, since you&rsquo;ll likely get no new information.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&rsquo;m considering renaming this article to &ldquo;Episode 47 and a half: In which I fail at spelling the word &lsquo;Episode&rsquo; in the title the first time around.&rdquo;</p>
