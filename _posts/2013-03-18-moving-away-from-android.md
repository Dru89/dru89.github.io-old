Near the beginning of my freshmen year of college, I decided to get an [Android Dev Phone 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Dev_Phone#Android_Dev_Phone_1) â€” the unlocked, developer version of the [HTC Dream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream).  It was super-expensive, it couldn't use 3G on AT&T bands, it was slow and had no touch-screen keyboard (which was unusable even when it was added), but it was mine.  I loved the phone.  I never really developed for it, because I didn't know nearly as much about Java as I thought I did.  I eventually decided to put a custom ROM on it, which was more difficult than I had hoped.  There was a bug in the phone that "unrooted" my developer phone.  I don't quite recall the reasons, but it was annoying.

A year or two later, I upgraded my device to a [Droid 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Droid_2).  It was much better.  Still, it got slow as time went on.  Verizon's updates never came on time.  I rooted it, put [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) on it.  I kept it a year and a half (truth be told, I still have it), and upgraded to a [Samsung Galaxy Nexus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus).  It was a great device when I got it.  I loved how fluid everything was.  The whole thing was starting to feel boring, though.  Add to that my frustration with Verizon for never updating the phone on time, along with the fact that they blocked Google Wallet.  It took 6 months longer for them to push out the 4.1 update.  They still haven't pushed out a 4.2 update, and have since announced that they will no longer support a device that's _less than 2 years old_.

I fought for months trying to decide what phone I wanted to get.  My contract wasn't up, but my phone was effectively left to die by Verizon.  If contracts are forced to be two years, support for devices should be at least two years as well, but I digress.  I decided that I didn't want to use Android phones anymore.  It's not that I hated the devices, but they seemed so boring at this point.  I didn't know what phone I should go with.  iPhones are so popular, but they just didn't feel right to me.  Blackberry was out of the question.  Microsoft had come to the University not long before to do a development workshop on Windows Phone 7.  It looked intriguing, and I love .NET development.  I decided to wait a few months, though.

Luckily, when I waited I heard the announcement from Microsoft that Windows Phone 8 was coming.  The bad news for Windows Phone 7 users was that Windows Phone 8 would not work on their devices.  The kernels were too diferent.  This was disappointing news, but I was glad to have waited.  I wound up with AT&T and a red [Nokia Lumia 920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920).

That was a month ago.  Today I have been using this phone for a month, and I couldn't be happier.  I won't say that it comes without problems.  I'm experiencing a lot of the same problems that I experienced with my first Android.  Mostly, there's not enough content.  Buying this phone was a huge risk.  I had invested a lot of time and money in making my Android phone "just right."  If I had to go back, though, I would still change.  My experience with Windows Phone 8 so far has been wonderful.  I can't wait to see what's next.

**Edit:** So just this morning, I saw that Verizon is pushing out the [Galaxy Nexus 4.2 update](http://news.verizonwireless.com/news/2013/03/galaxy-nexus-jelly-bean.html).  Well played, Verizon.  Well played.  I still dont' regret my decision to change carriers and move away from Android, though.
