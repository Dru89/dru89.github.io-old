[Lumia 920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_920) (Windows Phone) for a few months, the 
[Galaxy S4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S4), and finally the 
[Moto G 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_G_(2nd_generation)).  I've had a phone or tablet with every version of
Android from 1.0 to 5.1, including a tablet with
